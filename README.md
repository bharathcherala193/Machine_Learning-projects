## Project - 1: Used Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts the selling price of a used car using Machine Learning.
I used Linear Regression to understand how different car features affect the resale price.

The goal of this project is to learn and apply basic Machine Learning concepts on a real-world problem.

### 🧠 Problem Statement

Used car prices depend on many factors such as:

car age

kilometers driven

fuel type

transmission type

number of previous owners

This project builds a model that estimates the price of a car based on these details.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

### 🔍 Project Workflow

Load and understand the dataset

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Create new feature Car Age

Convert categorical data into numerical format

Split data into training and testing sets

Apply feature scaling

Train model using Linear Regression

Evaluate model performance

Predict price for new car data

### 📊 Results & Observations

Older cars generally have lower prices.

Higher kilometers driven reduce resale value.

Linear Regression was able to predict car prices reasonably well.

Model performance was evaluated using R² Score and Mean Squared Error.
